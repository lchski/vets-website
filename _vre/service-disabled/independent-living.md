VA may provide independent-living services if your service-connected disability impairs your ability to work and you need these services to live more independently. You may also receive independent-living services as you work to gain employment if thatâ€™s a goal you and your counselor have created. 

In both cases, your counselor can help you restore your daily-living activities.

<div class="call-out" markdown="1">
### Are you eligible for independent-living services?

Yes, if:

- You are eligible for VR&amp;E benefits.
- You have a service-connected disability rating of 20&#37; or higher. 
- Your injuries prevent you from immediately seeking or returning to employment.

### How to Apply

You may get a referral from your case manager after enrolling in the [Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment](/vre/apply-vre/) program.

<li class="step one wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">
A Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) will work with you to determine if you are not yet ready for employment because of the severity of your service-connected disabilities. The counselor will also determine if you will benefit from independent-living services.
</li>

<li class="step two wow fadeIn animated" markdown="1">
Then, a counselor appointed through [Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment](/vre/apply-vre/) will help you personalize an independent-living plan for your needs. The services generally last up to 24 months, but in some situations they may be extended beyond this time frame. 
</li>

<li class="step three last wow fadeIn animated animated" markdown="0">
Independent-living services may include evaluation and counseling to identify your needs and goals; home consultations with specialists; referral to support resources; and guidance in understanding your eligibility for VA home-modification programs. 
</li>
